In this repository I have uploaded three notebooks each targetting different parts of deeplearning: classification problem, Natural Languagae processing (email spam or not), and 
a time series problem to predict the rootcause.(All of these three projects may not neccessarily be classified as deep learning problems but at the very least are a good introduction to the concept).
The aim of my prject was to provide a quick and concise summary of these concepts of machine learning and deep learning to people who dont want to spend alot of time trying 
and experimenting with concepts to reach the same conclusions as i have in these noteboks.
